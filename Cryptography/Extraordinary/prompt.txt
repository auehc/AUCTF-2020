On their way back from the market, Alice and Bob noticed a little device on the ground. Next to it was a piece of paper with what looked like a bunch of scrambled numbers on it. It looked completely random. They took it to the lost and found, but on their way they played with it a little bit (don't tell anyone!). The device was never picked up, so we get to play with it a little bit, too. Can you figure out how the device works?
