Another RSA problem.

This was originally meant to be a CCA attack on RSA, but could server constraints, and complications led to this problem.

The way you can solve this problem is the bypass to the previous RSA problem.

1. calculate the values of every ascii value by taking it's integer value and raising it to e mod n.

2. find the corresponding values within the given ciphertext

3. translate
