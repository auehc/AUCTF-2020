This is encrypted using the bacon cipher, then translated into morse code and pushed to an audio file.

We are given the attached file: mystery_signal.wav
After listening to the wav file, it is easily recognizable as morse code, So we translate that into morse code using a website like https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html:

And find that it translates to something consisting of only Bs and As. After a little research, it can be found that a cipher called the bacon cipher looks a lot like this:

Bacon Message: BABAAAABAAABABAABABAAABBBAAAAABAABBAABAABAABAABBABABABBAABAAAABAABAABAAAAAAABBAAABBABBAABAAABBBAABAABAAAAAAABBAAAAABABBABABAAAABAABAAAAAABAAAABAABABABABBBAAABAAAAABABAABAABAAAABBAAAABBABAABAAABBBAABAAABABBBAABAABBABAAABAABBABABABBAABAAAABBBAABAABAAAAAABAABAAABABBABABBABABBAABAABAAABBBAABAAABABBAABAABAAABBAAABAAAAAAABBAAABAAAABBBAAAAABAAABBAABAABBABAAAABAABAAAAABBAABAAABABAABAAABAABBAABAABAAAAAABAAAAABBBAAABABBABABBABABBAAABBABBAABAAABBBAABAABAAAABABAAABAAABAAABAABAAAAAAAABABAABABAABAAABAAABAABABABBABBAAAAABBAAAAAAABAABBAABBAAABBBBAABABAABAAABBBAABAAAABABABABAAAAAAAABBAABAAABAAABAAAAABAABBAAABABAABAAABABBAAABABBABABABBAABAAABBABABBAAAABAAABBAAAABAAAABAAAAABBBAAABBAABAABBABAAABAAAAAAABABAABABABAABAAABBBAABAAAABABAAABAAAABAABBABABBAABAABAAABBBAABAABAAABAABAAAAABABAAAAAAAAABABBBBABBAAABABAAAAABAAAAABABBAABAABAAAABAAAB

Translated using a decoder like the one found here https://www.dcode.fr/bacon-cipher, we get the following:
WELL HAVE TO MEET ANOTHER DAY WERE EXPECTING THEM TO COME HERE SOON THE MESSAGE HAS TO BE DELIVERED SOON OTHERWISE ALL IS FOR NAUGHT THE FLAG IS AUCTF SOMEONE NEEDS TO CALL THE FCC ON THESE CRAZY FARMERS 

From that, we see that the flag is AUCTF SOMEONE NEEDS TO CALL THE FCC ON THESE CRAZY FARMERS
