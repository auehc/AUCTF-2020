Extract the .gz file to reveal a sql dump, inside the table there is a .7z file containing an image. Import the mySQL table to reassemble the 7z file.
sudo mysql -u user -p'fdsafds' -e "USE test; SELECT image FROM images INTO DUMPFILE '/tmp/boom';"
Extract the 7z file to reveal the image. Finally, decrease the brightness and increase the contrast of the image to reveal the flag.
