# Remote School

Dear Student,

Due to COVID-19 concerns our curriculum will be moving completely to online courses... I know we haven't even started our school year yet so this may come as a shock. But I promise it won't be too bad! You can login at `challenges.auctf.com 30013`.

Best, Dean of Eon Pillars
