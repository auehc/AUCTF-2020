# Cracker Barrel

I found a USB drive under the checkers board at cracker barrel. My friends told me not to plug it in but surely nothing bad is on it?

I found this file, but I can't seem to unlock it's secrets. Can you help me out?

Also.. once you think you've got it I think you should try to connect to `challenges.auctf.com` at port `30000` not sure what that means, but it written on the flash drive..
